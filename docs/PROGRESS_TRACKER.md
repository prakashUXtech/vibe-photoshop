## API Implementation Notes (Based on Official Documentation)

Based on the official Gemini documentation, we'll implement:

1. **Model Endpoint**: Using `models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp` for image generation

2. **SDK Setup**:
   ```javascript
   import { genai } from '@google/genai';
   const client = genai.Client(apiKey);
   ```

3. **Response Configuration**:
   ```javascript
   config: {
     responseModalities: ["Text", "Image"]
   }
   ```

4. **Supported Generation Modes**:
   - Text to image (e.g., "Generate an image of the Eiffel tower with fireworks")
   - Text to image + text (e.g., "Generate an illustrated recipe for paella")
   - Image editing (e.g., "Edit this image to make it look like a cartoon")
   - Multi-turn editing (e.g., Upload image → "Turn this car into a convertible" → "Now change the color to yellow")

5. **Implementation Pattern**:
   ```javascript
   const response = await client.models.generateContent({
     model: "models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
     contents: prompt,
     config: {
       responseModalities: ["Text", "Image"]
     }
   });
   
   // Process response parts
   for (const part of response.candidates[0].content.parts) {
     if (part.text !== null) {
       // Handle text
     } else if (part.inlineData !== null) {
       // Process image data
       const imageData = part.inlineData.data;
       // Display or save image
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Key Limitations**:
   - Image generation may not always trigger (use explicit prompts)
   - Generation may stop partway through (implement retry logic)
   - Best language support: EN, es-MX, ja-JP, zh-CN, hi-IN
   - No audio/video input support
   - For text rendering in images, generate text first then ask for image
   - All generated images include a SynthID watermark

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 2: Setup & Configuration
2. Install the Google GenAI SDK and other dependencies
3. Implement the basic project structure
4. Set up Firebase integration
5. Create the authentication system
6. Begin work on the image generation UI

## Timeline

- Phase 1 (Planning): Complete
- Phase 2-4 (Setup, UI, Auth): Day 1
- Phase 5-7 (API, Storage, Versioning): Day 2
- Phase 8-10 (Gallery, Testing, Deployment): Day 3

## Dependencies

- Firebase project setup
- Gemini API access (user-provided keys)
- Google GenAI SDK (`@google/genai`)
- SvelteKit and required npm packages
